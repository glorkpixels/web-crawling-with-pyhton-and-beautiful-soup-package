# Web Crawling wih Python with BeautifulSoup package


Python Code will firstly go to the website
>http://finans.mynet.com/borsa/hisseler/adana-adana-cimento-a/tarihselveriler/.
This website is about market data of “ADANA ÇİMENTO (A)”.

Secondly, your code will take the day number as an input from the user. Your code will take data
from the current date to past based on the day number. Thirdly, your code will show two charts:
line chart and bar chart. Your line chart will show “Son Fiyat” based on the days, and your bar
chart will show “Hacim” based on the days. You have to be careful about the day number since it
cannot be greater than the work days of a month.
